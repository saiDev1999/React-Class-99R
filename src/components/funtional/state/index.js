// state is nothing its a container layer of application 
// State : State is a react built in object which holds the data or information of the component 
// State is mutable --> we can change over the time-period 


// we can update the state using setState method in react class based components 

// whenever state changes component will re-render to show the updated content in the layout


// example : Youtube button 

// initial Data or initial State ---> Subscribe 
// when we click it turns to updated state ---> Subscribed

// State is private to the component
